## **internet terms**

domains are the addresses of the internet. Domain names (something.com) are masking addresses for the IP addresses of websites. These are vital as they give the IP addresses easy names to rememeber. Web servers are any computer/software that serves content to the web. They cab be found by typing in the address on a domain (url) into a webbrowser, which displays the content from the web server onto the screen in a presentable way. The url can be accessed quickly via the system of DNS which finds outs the IP address for the domain you are trying to access, and relays that infomation back to your computer when you request access to a website.

The development of the world wide web was one of the most significant advancements of the internet. Without it, the internet would not have the graphical display capability needed for the commercial expansion of the internet, which fuelled its growth. The world wide web made the internet accessible to non-geeks, and this meant that total traffic increased, fuelling demand.
