        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I’m James<br><br>I’m a full stack web developer who has worked in many different industries that led me to coding. I have extensive experience working in support functions for many organisations. Seeing how and product or process would affect the end user has motivated me to make building products my new career.                    
        In my prior career I had exposure to coding but no first-hand experience in it, learning how it operates I saw the potential in well written programming and push myself to see how my code can be simplified whilst remaining legible.                    
        I enjoy challenge and strategic thinking, outside of work I can be found reading up on history and playing long form strategic games, I’ve found these hobbies have made me excellent at learning from the past and approaching problems from a different angle.
